The SSD-Image includes a dashboard (MMDVMHost-Dashboard by DG9VH) and a web interface for configuration with the necessary personal data. This is done with your normal web browser, for example with your notebook. Therefore the RPi is connected with a network cable to your LAN and can be reached via the DHCP-assigned IP address.

It is our goal to allow every amateur radio operator setting up a personal DVMega hotspot within shortest time, by applying this easy to install image. So using digital voice communications is easily accomplished.

The main focus is to build a SSD-Image for the Raspberry Pi Hardware combined with the DVMega shield. Some of our scripts can be also used by an ordinary MMDVM-Repeater Setup, as well. 

Please do not hesitiate to give us your feedback for improments or be a part of the development.

## How to install ?

First of all, please use a SD-Card image. You can find it at our website http://www.bm262.de

But, if you think it is a good idea to build it step-by-step, you can clone from the repo.  

On a fresh and clean Raspberry Pi Debian installation goto /opt and clone the repository from github. 
 
	cd /opt
	git clone https://github.com/dl5rfk/easyBM.git
	cd /opt/easyBM/
